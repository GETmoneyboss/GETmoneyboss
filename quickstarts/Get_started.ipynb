        "\n",
        "Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown for how you can go about building a machine learning model to predict the Louisiana Pick 4 and Pick 5 lottery numbers using various predictive algorithms:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Install Dependencies\n",
        "\n",
        "You can install the required libraries like `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, and `prophet` in Python by running:\n",
        "\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "!pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy prophet\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 2: Data Extraction\n",
        "\n",
        "You can manually download the historical winning numbers for both games from these links:\n",
        "\n",
        "- [Pick 4 Results](https://louisianalottery.com/m/winning-numbers/?tname=pick4)\n",
        "- [Pick 5 Results](https://louisianalottery.com/m/winning-numbers/?tname=pick5)\n",
        "\n",
        "The data on the website might be in a tabular format. Once you've downloaded the data, you can use `pandas` to read it and process the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Data Preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "After gathering the data, you'll want to clean it and prepare it for analysis. Let's assume you have downloaded the winning number data into CSV format, one for Pick 4 and one for Pick 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import pandas as pd\n",
        "\n",
        "# Load your datasets\n",
        "pick4_data = pd.read_csv('path_to_pick4_data.csv')\n",
